A quiz file designed for use with the Quizzer v1.0 program is constructed
in accordance with the following simple format rules.


1 ... Quiz files are simply plain text files but they are given the
      file extension ".quiz" to distinguish them from other files
      and identify them to the program.
      
      
2 ... The first line in the quiz file consists of a <TITLE> tag, similar
      to the one used in HTML, followed by the title that will be shown
      when the user takes the quiz.  There is no closing tag, since it
      is all contained on a single line.      
      
      
3 ... Each question is contained on a single line starting with a <Q> tag
      and the line can be of any length.
      

4 ... Each series of multiple-choice answers occupies a single line starting
      with an <A> tag immediately following the line with the corresponding
      question.  The answers are each separated by a delimiting | character
      (ASCII code 124) and there can be up to 6 possible multi-choice answers
      per question.  The correct answer in the list must be marked with a
      preceding * (asterisk) character.


A quiz may have any number of questions by simply following the same format
for each question and series of multiple choice answers.

Below is a simple example of the format for a 3 question quiz file with the
title "Science 101"

The file name could be "Science_101.quiz"


-------------------


<TITLE>Science 101
<Q>The most abundant element in the universe is ...
<A>*Hydrogen|Water|Helium|Oxygen|Nitrogen|None of these answers.
<Q>The only planet with a ring system in our solar system is ...
<A>Jupiter|Saturn|Uranus|Neptune|*None of these answers apply.
<Q>When it is summer in North America, it is winter in ...
<A>*Australia|Japan|Europe|None of these answers.

NOTES:

When the program runs the quiz, the questions and the related answers
are given in a randomized order each time.

The very first line in the quiz data file is the <TITLE> line.

Notice the delimiters between the multiple choice answers and that the
correct answer is marked with an asterisk in the answers line.  It makes
no difference where the correct answer is in the line, as long as it is
marked by an asterisk.  The asterisk character tells the program which
answer is the correct one so it can respond properly to the quiz taker's
guesses.

The <TAGS> at the beginning of each line are NOT case sensitive.


There is a 10 question demo quiz data file provided with the program source
code which can also be viewed with a text editor like NotePad and used as a
guide to creating another quiz file.

The program looks in the same folder as the executable for the quiz data
files.  All quiz data files found will be listed by the program and can be
selected by simply double-clicking on the filename.
